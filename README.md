*TASK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK*

DESCRIPTION
This project is a simple yet flexible framework for managing tasks in a reproducible, automated manner. It uses:

A "TaskManager" class (with SQLAlchemy) to handle database interactions (e.g., task creation, completion).
A Python decorator ("@task") to wrap user-defined functions, automatically caching results on disk for reproducibility.
An optional config file (config.yaml or Python config file) for storing database credentials, paths, and other settings.
The framework supports:

Relational databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) via SQLAlchemy.
Automatic “caching” of function outputs (DataFrame, dict, etc.) to files (CSV, JSON, TXT).
Task state management (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED).
Eager or lazy retrieval of previously computed results.
FOLDER STRUCTURE
A typical folder layout for this project might look like:

task-management/ ├── LICENSE (optional license file) ├── README.txt (this document, describing your project) ├── pyproject.toml (modern build config, optional) ├── setup.py (classic setuptools build config, optional) ├── src/ │ └── task_management/ │ ├── init.py │ ├── config.py │ ├── decorators.py │ ├── models.py │ ├── task_manager.py │ └── other modules... ├── config.yaml (optional YAML config for DB credentials, etc.) ├── requirements.txt ├── results/ └── venv/ (your virtual environment, typically excluded from version control)

INSTALLATION FROM GITHUB
To make your project installable via pip from GitHub, ensure you have:

A valid setup.py (or pyproject.toml).
Your Python code in a proper package folder (e.g. src/task_management).
An init.py file in the package folder.
Then someone can install it with:

pip install git+https://github.com/youruser/yourrepo.git

They can also specify a specific commit or tag, e.g.:

pip install git+https://github.com/youruser/yourrepo.git@v0.1.0

USAGE
SETTING UP A DATABASE

By default, the code references a SQLite database or whatever is specified in DEFAULT_DB_URL.
For PostgreSQL, the DB URL might look like: postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
CONFIGURING DEFAULTS

In config.py (or config.yaml), you can set: DEFAULT_DB_URL = "sqlite:///tasks.db" DEFAULT_RESULT_DIR = "results"
The code in decorators.py references these defaults if no arguments are passed to the @task decorator.
DEFINING A TASK

Import the "@task" decorator: from task_management.decorators import task

Wrap your function:

@task() def my_experiment(a, b, random_seed=123): # Some expensive computation return a + b

The first time you call my_experiment(2, 3), it will create a new task (PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED), run the function, store the output on disk, and store task metadata in the DB.

RE-USING / CACHING RESULTS

If you call my_experiment(2, 3) again with the same parameters, it detects that an identical task is COMPLETED, then automatically loads the cached result from disk instead of re-running the function.
EXAMPLE CODE

Suppose you have main.py:

from task_management.decorators import task

@task() def my_task(x): print("Running with x =", x) return {"square": x*x}

if name == "main": out1 = my_task(5) print("Result:", out1)

bash
Copy
  out2 = my_task(5)  # Should return cached result
  print("Cached result:", out2)
CONFIGURATION FILE (OPTIONAL)
If you want to store database credentials, output directories, or other settings externally, you can use:

A YAML file (config.yaml)
A Python file (config.py) Or environment variables.
An example config.yaml:

db: user: "myuser" password: "mypassword" host: "localhost" port: 5432 name: "mydatabase"

app: output_dir: "results"

Then you can load it with PyYAML in your code, build the DB URL, and pass it to the TaskManager or the @task decorator.

TASK STATES & DATABASE TABLES
The models.py file typically defines:

TaskHeader: immutable metadata (task key, random seed, input_params, etc.)
TaskState: mutable state (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, etc.) They’re linked by a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.
When you create a task, a row in TaskHeader + TaskState is inserted. Once the task is completed, the row in TaskState is updated to COMPLETED.

LOCAL FILE CACHING
The decorator saves outputs to: {output_dir}/{module_name_with_underscores}/{function_name}/ Each file is named with the pattern: functionName_taskId_timestamp.(csv|json|txt)

When the same task is invoked again with identical parameters, the code looks up the existing TaskHeader with state == COMPLETED, and if found, loads the file from disk.

ADVANCED FEATURES
Resuming tasks:
You can store partial results, track steps, or define dependencies.
Logging & error handling:
The database or logs can record exceptions.
Distributed computing:
Each node can run tasks, store local copies, and optionally share them via a central repository or peer-to-peer.
